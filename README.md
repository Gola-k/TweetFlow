# Crypto Airdrop Token Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a crypto airdrop token on the **CrossFi Testnet** using the token `CTKN` (CrossToken). It provides a complete implementation, including tokenomics, smart contract deployment, and airdrop distribution mechanisms. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you set up and manage a successful airdrop campaign.

---

### Features

- **Token Deployment:** Create and deploy `CTKN`, an ERC-20 compatible token, for distribution on the CrossFi Testnet.
- **Customizable Airdrop:** Define and configure airdrop criteria to distribute tokens effectively.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Fully integrated with the CrossFi Testnet for deployment and testing.
- **Developer Tools:** Uses industry-standard tools like Remix and Hardhat for development and deployment.
